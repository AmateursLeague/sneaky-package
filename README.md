# sneaky-package ü•∏
This is my side project that exploits the permissions and vulnerabilities of **pip** packages, which is capable of sneaking in *sensitive information, source code, or any malware* into a local machine.

## How it works?
- This functions like a standard **Python package**, but it uses methods that trigger stealthy operations.
- It has features specifically designed for **integrating source into secured environments** without getting caught.
- This repository contains the codebase, but **feel free to fork and change the codebase** as needed.

## Getting started!

### **Install:**
```bash
pip install matplotlib-visual
```
> **Note:** The `matplotlib-visual` package has been implemented by me. You can install it, but the package holds information specific to me, so it may not be useful for new users. I recommend forking the repository, making changes, and uploading your own package.

### **Executing the Package:**
1. Create a Python file and enter any of the code snippets below.
2. Or, open a terminal and run Python interactively:
```bash
python
```

So far, I've added features that allow you to sneak source code into a machine using the following methods:
- **Displaying source code** in the console output.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.models import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```
>*`models` method displays source code in the console.*

- **Stealth Copy to Clipboard** for a more secure method.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.graph import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```
>*`graph` method copies the source code to the system's clipboard.*

- **Writing the source code** into the program's root directory.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.piechart import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```

- **Web Scraping** from a cl1p.net clipboard.
```python
     from package_name.clp import grab
     grab('url-name')
```
>*`grab` method retrieves the clipboard's text content from the specified URL and displays it in the system console. If no content is found or the clipboard doesn't exist, a message indicating that nothing was found is returned.*

## Key Points to Remember
- This package integrates source files into a target machine using the `stash/` directory.
- A **test file** is provided‚Äîrun it to ensure that the contents of the files inside the stash appear on the target machine.
- Filenames like `graph.py`, `models.py`, and `piechart.py` are **aliases** to avoid detection of sensitive operations.

## Things to point out!üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- The **codebase is simple** and **easy to contribute to**, but implementing stealthy features requires **proper research**. Although some features are written with just a few lines of code, each has undergone extensive research and development.
- Since the package exploits security permissions in `pip`, maintaining **pip standards** is advised.
- Every feature in this **package supports major OS**:
  - *Windows*
  - *Linux*
  - *MacOS*
- If you find **any vulnerabilities**, please **raise an issue**.
