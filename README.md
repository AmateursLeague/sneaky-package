# sneaky-package

This is project, which I created to find and exploit the security of the systems using the Python's own pip install.
### 1. Installation 🥸:

Install ***python package*** using the following command:

```
pip install matplotlib-visual
```
> **Node:** The above package **matplotlib-visual** uses the same codebase as this repository. You can **update/change/remove** the package features as per your need.

### 2. Create a New Python File 👀:

Once the package is installed, create a new `.py` file and enter the following code to execute the features:

```python
from matplotlib_visual.models import display
display('filename') # the name of the source code you have saved in the directory
```
> `filename` - Enter filename, that is stored inside **code_snippets**.

# Features

- Displaying text in console output using **`models`** package.
- Copying text into system clipboard using **`graph`** package.
- Writing the text file into root directory of the executing program using **`piechart`** package. 

# Purpose and Ethical Use
This project is created for ethically intruding into a machine using Python's **pip install**. The primary purpose of this package is educational, aiming to highlight and improve security measures by demonstrating potential vulnerabilities in systems.
