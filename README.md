python
```

##📊Progress fo far-
- **📍Displaying source code** in the console output.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.models import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```
>*`models` method displays source code in the console.*

- **📍Stealth Copy to Clipboard** for a more secure method.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.graph import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```
>*`graph` method copies the source code to the system's clipboard.*

- **📍Writing the source code** into the program's root directory.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.piechart import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```

- **📍Web Scraping** from a cl1p.net clipboard.
```python

##📑Note for Contributors-

- This package integrates source files into a target machine using the `stash/` directory.
- A **test file** is provided—run it to ensure that the contents of the files inside the stash appear on the target machine.
- Filenames like `graph.py`, `models.py`, and `piechart.py` are **aliases** to avoid detection of sensitive operations.
- Since the package exploits security permissions in `pip`, maintaining **pip standards** is advised.
