## ⛓️ What is a **Pip Package**? ⛓️

For those who are unaware of what a **pip package** is, a pip package allows the user to manage, install, update, and remove Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPi). These packages contain a collection of libraries and modules that can be further used in your code.


## 🟡Technologies Used 
The project is based totally on Python, that is a high-level programming language known for its clear syntax and readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners. Contributors should keep in mind that this package exploits security permissions in pip, so it is expected that you maintain pip standards while working.

## 🪪Licence
The purpose of this project is educational and the intend is just to test the vulneribilities of pip package. This package is licensed under the [GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), allowing you to sneakily use and modify it as needed.

## How To get Started-
--- 

### **🔧Instalations:**
```bash
pip install matplotlib-visual
```
> **Note:** The `matplotlib-visual` package has been implemented by [Project Manager](https://github.com/this-is-yaash) and has details specific to him, you are sugested to follow the steps above and fork the repository and upload a package.

### **⏱️Execution:**
1. Create a Python file and enter any of the code snippets below.
2. Or, open a terminal and run Python interactively:
```bash
python
```

### 📊Progress fo far-
- **📍Displaying source code** in the console output.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.models import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```
>*`models` method displays source code in the console.*

- **📍Stealth Copy to Clipboard** for a more secure method.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.graph import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```
>*`graph` method copies the source code to the system's clipboard.*

- **📍Writing the source code** into the program's root directory.
```python
    from matplotlib_visual.piechart import display
    display("<filename-without-extension>")
```

- **📍Web Scraping** from a cl1p.net clipboard.
```python
     from package_name.clp import grab
     grab('url-name')
```
>*`grab` method retrieves the clipboard's text content from the specified URL and displays it in the system console. If no content is found or the clipboard doesn't exist, a message indicating that nothing was found is returned.*
