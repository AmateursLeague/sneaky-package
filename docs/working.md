# **How it Works?**

## **Overview**

**matplotlib-visual** is a Python package designed to streamline the handling and sharing of content with various built-in features like displaying, copying to clipboard, writing to files, and interacting with content on [cl1p.net](https://cl1p.net), a web-based clipboard service.

The package includes the following features:

- **`show`**: Display specified content.
- **`clip`**: Copy content to the system clipboard.
- **`write`**: Save content to a file.
- **`scrap`**: Fetch content from cl1p.net.
- **`create`**: Store content on cl1p.net.

## **Installation**

To get started, install the **matplotlib-visual** package via pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib-visual
```

## **Project Structure**

The package contains `.py` files for each feature located in:

```sh
├── docs/                  # Documentation files
├── package/               # Main package files
│   ├── stash/             # Feature implementation files
│       └── test/py        # Integration files
│   ├── show.py            # Implementation for displaying content
│   ├── clip.py            # Implementation for clipboard functionality
│   ├── write.py           # Implementation for writing to files
│   ├── scrap.py           # Implementation for fetching content from cl1p.net
│   └── create.py          # Implementation for storing content on cl1p.net
├── scripts/               # Scripts for installation and building
│   ├── install.sh         # Installation script
│   └── build.sh           # Build script
├── tests/                 # Unit tests for the package
├── CHANGELOG.md           # Change log for version updates
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md     # Code of conduct for contributors
├── LICENSE                # License file
├── mkdocs.yml             # Configuration for documentation site
├── README.md              # Overview of the package
└── setup.py               # Setup script for package installation
```

Make sure to store the `.py` files in the `stash/` folder so that they can be accessed using the features we have.

## **How to Use**

After installing the package, you can access its features by importing them into your Python environment.

### **1. Display Content with `show`**

To display any text or data, use the `display` function from `package.show`.

```python
from package.show import display
display('test')
```

### **2. Copy to Clipboard with `clip`**

To copy text to your system’s clipboard, use the `display` function from `package.clip`.

```python
from package.clip import display
display('test')
```

### **3. Write Content to File with `write`**

To save content into a file, use the `plot` function from `package.write`. The content will be saved in the root directory of your current execution environment.

```python
from package.write import plot
plot('test')
```

### **4. Fetch Content from cl1p.net with `scrap`**

To retrieve previously stored content from cl1p.net, use the `grab` function from `package.scrap`, specifying the unique URL name.

```python
from package.scrap import grab
grab('url-name')
```

### **5. Store Content on cl1p.net with `create`**

To store content on cl1p.net under a specific URL name, use the `create` function from `package.create`.

```python
from package.create import display
create('the content to be stored', 'url-name')
```

## **Additional Notes**

- Make sure that any URLs you use with `scrap` and `create` are accessible and unique to avoid conflicts on cl1p.net.
- This package is ideal for quickly sharing and saving snippets of text or notes across platforms and with other applications.
